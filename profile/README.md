We are an open-source organization building the foundations of a new kind of operating system — one where **modularity is not an afterthought, but the architecture itself.**

Our work sits at the intersection of systems programming, language-driven safety, and adaptive computing. We believe that the next generation of operating systems should be able to observe their own behavior, replace their own components at runtime, and recover from failures without human intervention.

Everything we build is written in **Rust**, runs on **bare metal**, and compiles with **zero dependency on any existing OS or standard library**. We design frameworks first and implementations second — so that anyone can take the interfaces we define and build something entirely their own.

### What We Care About

🔩 &ensp; **Separation of mechanism and policy** — the core should provide primitives, not opinions.

🧬 &ensp; **Trait-driven architecture** — every boundary in the system is an interface that can be reimplemented.

♻️ &ensp; **Live evolution** — software that can be updated, swapped, and healed while it runs.

🛡️ &ensp; **Safety without compromise** — memory safety at the language level, fault isolation at the architecture level.

🌍 &ensp; **Openness** — MIT-licensed, community-driven, built in public.
